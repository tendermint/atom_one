This is a proposal to finalize the ATOM ONE constitution with feedback and
contributions from the community to adopt the final form as the constitution of
the Cosmos Hub.

See ATOM ONE Constitution draft: github.com/tendermint/atom_one

For the purpose of finalizing the ATOM ONE Constitution for the Cosmos Hub, the
passage of this proposal shall impose a moratorium for a period starting from
the submission of this proposal until 2 weeks after the voting period has
complete, during which time proposals in conflict with the spirit of ATOM ONE
should be rejected.

The spirit of ATOM ONE are as follows:

 * Any proposal to inflate the amount of ATOMs beyond the default inflation
   scheme must require an explicit two thirds supermajority YES vote to pass,
   along with a specific purpose for its inflation.

 * Any proposal to change the tokenomics of ATOMs must include explicit
   procedures to defend against hostile takeovers of Cosmos Hub governance,
   rather than based on assumptions of adoption.

 * Any proposal to change the tokenomics of ATOMs must be described in a
   constitution document that describes the procedures for tweaking the
   parameters of the system, as well as updating the constitution itself, the
   latter which must require an explicit two thirds supermajority YES vote to
   pass. 

 * Any proposal to install a constitution for the Cosmos Hub must focus
   primarily on security, and secondarily on increasing the value of the blockspace 
   secured by ATOM, as well as enabling permissionless opt-in innovation
   in new zones. The value of blockspace can be measure by fee paying transactions 
   that pass through the distribution module and by other innovations like 
   such blockproposer auctions, priority auctions, novel alternatives to fee 
   markets, etc. The core goal is increasing the amount of value passed to stakers 
   over time.

Until the governance mechanism is improved to allow for this type of proposal,
a proposal that requires a two thirds majority of YES votes as according to
above items, but does not meet the two thirds majority shall be deemed to have
failed, even if it passes with a one half simple majority. 

Improvements to the ATOM ONE constitution should be coordinated primarily by
pull requests to the github repo: github.com/tendermint/atom_one
